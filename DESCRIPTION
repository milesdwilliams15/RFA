Version: 0.1

Description: Random Forest Residualization is a procedure for estimating the 
    average treatment effect (ATE) of some predictor on a response from 
    observational data. As the name implies, the routine uses random forest 
    (RF) regression to subtract away the variance in the predictor and 
    response as explained by a set of confounding variables prior to 
    estimating the ATE.
